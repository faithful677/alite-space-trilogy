# Description
Mobile Game development is an exemplary platform that connects content with consumers. According to a report by StatCounter, the pandemic witnessed a significant increase in mobile game downloads in Western Europe in the first quarter of 2020. Countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain witnessed a substantial increase in mobile game downloads with 97, 89, 75, and 66 million downloads, respectively. Thus, mobile game development is a worthwhile enterprise, especially in this current global climate.

The ability to adapt aspects of a game according to preference plays a significant role in the popularity and enjoyment of traditional board games according to an experiment conducted by Malatras and et al entitled â€œExploiting traditional gameplay characteristics to enhance digital board games".

This project attempts to port these concepts by enabling three variations, with characters taking on distinct roles according to the plot. The project was developed in Android Studio with the Java programming language (version 4.1.2). Tests were performed on Google Pixel 3a API 30.

The features of the project are attached below along with their priorities in order of decreasing importance. 

The features that were not implemented were the least valuable to the user such as:
A video demonstration of the instructions of the game; and
The execution of the game in landscape mode. 

However, the most valuable features were implemented. These include:
The use of an onscreen Joystick for movement;
Measurement of progress;
The ability to play different variations of the game;
The ability to play the role of the antagonist and the protagonist within the same game. 
And the ability to control several characters.
